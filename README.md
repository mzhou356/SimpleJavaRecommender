# SimpleJavaRecommender
> This simple Java Recommender Project is an extension of the [Movie Recommendation System Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-recommender/home/welcome), which is the final course of the([Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming) by the Duke University.

> Over the years, there have been many advanced algorithms for recommendation systems such as matrix factorization, cluster-based approaches, probabilistic methods, and more. This simple project focuses on nearest neighbor collaborative filtering algorithm.
